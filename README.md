# milliGrad
This is a basic tensor and neural networks package built on top of numpy.  It
is essentially a vectorized version of Karpathy's
[micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).

I've included some notebooks demonstrating the use of this library for
specific tasks:

* [Linear regression](https://github.com/mdehling/milligrad/blob/main/demo/linear-regression.ipynb)
  ([Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mdehling/milligrad/blob/main/demo/linear-regression.ipynb))
* [Classification](https://github.com/mdehling/milligrad/blob/main/demo/classification.ipynb)
  ([Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mdehling/milligrad/blob/main/demo/classification.ipynb))

The easiest way to run these notebooks is either using the _Open in Colab_
links above, or by creating a GitHub Codespaces instance from this repository
and running them inside vscode.
